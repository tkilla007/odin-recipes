    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A shake for breakfast? Why not when it is healthy, right? This banana shake consists of six basic ingredients you likely always keep on hand and it can be ready in no time. Chocolate and peanut butter? count me in!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 large overripe bananas , peeled, sliced and frozen</li>
        <li>1 cup original almond milk (or more to thin as desired)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup ice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients to a blender a process until well pureed. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>The overripe bananas will add the sweetness for the smoothie so use some that have a generous amount of speckles, don't use black bananas though those are just gross.
        </li>
    </ol>
